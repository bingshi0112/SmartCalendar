SmartCalendar is more than a regular calendar. It could also alerts the users on how to enhance their lifestyle based on their calendar and relevant data. It will utilize cloud concepts such as scalability and elasticity to give user maximize using experience and save cost for developers. SmartCalendar’s “smartness” is not only represented by its on-demand provisioning but also by its ability to aggregate and parse data from various sources and utilize the data in a way beneficial for the user. For example, it will alert the user to carry an umbrella when there is a forecast of rain; it will update a user’s calendar based on current traffic. Additionally, it will give the user health tips such as when to eat, when to workout, and when to sleep, etc. The primary goal of this application is to aid our users in their time management in order to live a more efficient life.
